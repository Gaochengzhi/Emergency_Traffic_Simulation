## Getting Started

To get started, you have to download sumo https://www.eclipse.org/sumo/

If you are using Linux and apt, you can just paste the following command in your terminal:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:sumo/stable 
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sumo sumo-tools
pip install traci  ## important! I didn't use the traditional 
## path import method because I was lazy ðŸ˜…
```

## Have a quick run

```bash
cd src
python3 main.py
```

## Adjustment parameter

all the config files are in the cfg folder:

```bash
âžœ  cfg git:(main) âœ— ls
addition.xml            emergency.city.sumo.cfg output.trips0.xml       output.trips3.xml
autoGenTradic.sh        net.xml                 output.trips1.xml       trips.trips.xml
clib.xml                netback.jpg             output.trips2.xml
```

to change the route of the emergency vehicle, edit the `output.trips0.xml`
